<h1 align="center">Lintertin</h1>

> This is a simple Ruby linter, used to improve code quality and readability. Its name is Lintertin, linter because it's a linter, and tin from the end of my name (Martin) üòâ

You can test a single file, and also you can test all the files that exist in the root directory by using this linter.

## Good and Bad examples

### Trailing spaces

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  'def method   '
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  'def method'
  end
end

```

### Correct indentation

```Bad Example
class ForTest
def method
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method
  end
end

```

### Empty lines

```Bad Example
class ForTest

  def method
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method
  end
end

```

### Single empty line at the bottom of the file

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method
  end
end
```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method
  end
end

```

### Braces, brackets and parenthesis

Consider the following examples:

#### Parenthesis

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method(param
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method(param)
  end
end

```

#### Braces

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each { |n| puts n
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each { |n| puts n }
  end
end

```

#### Brackets

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    puts array[3
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    puts array[3]
  end
end

```

### Pipes |

#### Spaces before or after the pipe

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each do |elem |
    end
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each do |elem|
    end
  end
end

```

#### Missing pipe

```Bad Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each do |elem
    end
  end
end

```

```Good Example
class ForTest
  def method(array)
    array.each do |elem|
    end
  end
end

```

**Warning:** If there's a space before or after the pipe, then it will not check for a missing one.

**Warning:** This linter doesn't work with the inline `if` and inline `unless`!! For instance:

```
return 'something' if I'm_true\n
```

```
return 'something' unless I'm_true
```
